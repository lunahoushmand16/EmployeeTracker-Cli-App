# EmployeeTracker-Cli-App

Developers frequently need to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). This project is a command-line application that manages a company's employee database using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL. While traditional CMS platforms often have graphical interfaces, this CLI-based CMS enables efficient interaction with employee records through structured prompts, allowing users to add, update, and retrieve employee data seamlessly.

- **Motivation:** The motivation behind this project was to develop a structured and efficient way for businesses to manage their employee records without needing a complex GUI. By leveraging a command-line interface, users can interact with a company's employee database easily and efficiently.
- **Purpose:** The purpose of this application is to provide HR teams and managers with a streamlined way to manage employee information, including departments, roles, salaries, and reporting structures. This CLI tool eliminates the need for manual record-keeping and enables smooth database management.
- **What I Learned:** Through this project, I learned how to integrate PostgreSQL with Node.js, use the pg package for database interactions, and implement Inquirer.js for user-friendly CLI interactions. Additionally, I gained experience with handling SQL queries, foreign key constraints, and managing relational data structures effectively.
