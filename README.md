# EmployeeTracker-Cli-App

Developers frequently need to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). This project is a command-line application that manages a company's employee database using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL. While traditional CMS platforms often have graphical interfaces, this CLI-based CMS enables efficient interaction with employee records through structured prompts, allowing users to add, update, and retrieve employee data seamlessly.
